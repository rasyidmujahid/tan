"<strong>Post editor</strong> - Enter the text for your post. There are two "
"modes of editing: Visual and HTML. Choose the mode by clicking on the "

"clicking the icons above the post editor and following the directions. You "
"can go the distraction-free writing screen, new in 3.2, via the Fullscreen "
"icon in Visual mode (second to last in the top row) or the Fullscreen button "
"in HTML mode (last in the row). Once there, you can make buttons visible by "

"\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats#Supported_Formats\">descriptions "
